# Self-Balancing-Robot
##This code is a part of an academic work for the subject "Embedded Systems" from UFOP (Federal University of Ouro Preto).
In this code there is a LQR control implementation with a simple Kalman Filter to read the MPU-6050 sensor.
To run this code you need a MPU6050 sensor, an Arduino UNO (atmega-328p), two DC motors and a motor driver.

##Used Arduino Pins:
###A4,A5 - MPU6050
###Digital Pins 5,6 - PWM
###Digital Pins 8,9,10,11 - Motor Driver
